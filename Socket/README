Touchscreen ASR Correction Demo
-------------------------------
David Huggins-Daines <dhuggins@cs.cmu.edu>

Originally a project for an HCII course, later demoed at ACL 2008.

Prerequisites:

 - GStreamer 0.10
 - GTK+
 - Python 2.4 or newer
 - PocketSphinx and SphinxTrain Python modules installed
 - PocketSphinx GStreamer plugin installed

If you are on Ubuntu 9.10 or newer, you can achieve this by simply running:

sudo apt-get install python-pocketsphinx gstreamer0.10-pocketsphinx python-sphinxbase

On Ubuntu 9.10 and newer you should make sure that your GStreamer
properties are set to use PulseAudio for audio input, because the ALSA
plugin for PulseAudio works very badly.  Simply run
"gstreamer-properties" from the command-line and adjust them in the
GUI that pops up.

On older versions it is recommended that you use ALSA directly instead
(so long as you don't have it configured to use PulseAudio as its
default input device!)

On Maemo, you should be able to build packages in scratchbox using the
debian/ directories present in PocketSphinx and SphinxBase from the
SourceForge Subversion repository.  Then simply copy them to your
Internet Tablet and install.  You will of course also need to install
Python on the device.  After that it should Just Work.
